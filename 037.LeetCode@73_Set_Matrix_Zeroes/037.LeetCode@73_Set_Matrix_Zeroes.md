Given an m x n integer matrix `matrix`, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's.
You must do it in place.

Example 1:

![mat1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b4d7729-d658-4cbf-b636-0f21e4cec6e1)

- Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
- Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Example 2:

![mat2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72454a2f-244a-4b75-862c-356434097cf1)

- Input: matrix = [[0,1,2,0],[3,4,5,2],[1,3,1,5]]
- Output: [[0,0,0,0],[0,4,5,0],[0,3,1,0]]


Constraints:
- m == matrix.length
- n == matrix[0].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 200
- -231 <= matrix[i][j] <= 231 - 1


Follow up:
- A straightforward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
- A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
- Could you devise a constant space solution?
