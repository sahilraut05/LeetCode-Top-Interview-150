Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Example 1:

![rotate1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7303397e-6c5e-49d6-bacc-f86e03326d5b)

- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
- Output: [4,5,1,2,3]

Example 2:

![roate2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6233e34c-9629-45de-a95c-c0b25c1a7014)

- Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
- Output: [2,0,1]

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- 0 <= k <= 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>
