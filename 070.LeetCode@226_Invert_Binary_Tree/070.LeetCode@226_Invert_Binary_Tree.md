Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

Example 1:

![invert1-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/939c4c5f-8f31-4c26-b6b7-dc602c33a771)

- Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
- Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]

Example 2:

![invert2-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/211b5354-229f-4689-bb76-15348c1d012a)

- Input: root = [2,1,3]
- Output: [2,3,1]

Example 3:
- Input: root = []
- Output: []

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
