Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

![tmp-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0972271b-7078-4696-84b5-59bcf5301ddc)

- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: 3

Example 2:
- Input: root = [1,null,2]
- Output: 2

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10<sup>4<sup>].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
