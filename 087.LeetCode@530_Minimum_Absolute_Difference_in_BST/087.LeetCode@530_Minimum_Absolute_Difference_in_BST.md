Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

![bst1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37f79f5b-198b-484c-a332-c454ab6b35c5)

- Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
- Output: 1

Example 2:

![bst2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6a6aa98-46f1-4b01-8bd9-ad52cba39f7b)

- Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
- Output: 1

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- 0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>5</sup>
