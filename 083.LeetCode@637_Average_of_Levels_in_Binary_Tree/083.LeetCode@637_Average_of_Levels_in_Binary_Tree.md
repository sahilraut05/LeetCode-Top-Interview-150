Given the root of a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Example 1:

![avg1-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63058620-3e0d-46af-92bb-f074a5cf40d6)

- Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
- Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]
- Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11.
Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

Example 2:

![avg2-tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a8bcfe5-02e6-4393-a540-a99808c91eac)

- Input: root = [3,9,20,15,7]
- Output: [3.00000,14.50000,11.00000]

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10<sup>4</sup>].
- -231 <= Node.val <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1
