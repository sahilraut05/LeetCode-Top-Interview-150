Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:

![ex1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9620767-a2f9-466c-ad41-fb7b67fa1ee1)

- Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
- Output: true

Example 2:

![ex2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67cac975-f5dc-4913-bead-25959f601797)

- Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
- Output: false

Example 3:


- Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
- Output: false

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -10<sup>4</sup> <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>
