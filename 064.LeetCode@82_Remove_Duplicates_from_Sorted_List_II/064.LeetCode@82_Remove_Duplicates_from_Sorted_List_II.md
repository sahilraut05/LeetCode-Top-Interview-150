Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

Example 1:

![linkedlist1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1270ba47-d058-411f-bb85-d8d480f33413)

- Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
- Output: [1,2,5]

Example 2:

![linkedlist2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1be7c792-4c39-4a6f-bf0f-287f07690a04)

- Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
- Output: [2,3]

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
