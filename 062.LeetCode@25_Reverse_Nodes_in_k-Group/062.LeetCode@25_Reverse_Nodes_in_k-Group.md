Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:

![reverse_ex1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00ac6716-3179-422b-890d-9128419123c2)

- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
- Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:

![reverse_ex2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a02ce01-4881-4d1e-8c4c-27e3b8de9765)

- Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
- Output: [3,2,1,4,5]


Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 5000
- 0 <= Node.val <= 1000

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra memory space?
