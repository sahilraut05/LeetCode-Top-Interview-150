Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a  height-balanced binary search tree.

Example 1:

![btree1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6abdaf32-20c5-4400-a8ec-3f06231f8faf)

- Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
- Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
- Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

Example 2:

![btree2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae09b1a8-76ba-449a-8a41-3425578f48a7)

- Input: nums = [1,3]
- Output: [3,1]
- Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
