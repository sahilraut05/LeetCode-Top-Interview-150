Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

![kthtree1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a98739fb-25fa-444f-96ea-f3c96364341a)

- Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
- Output: 1

Example 2:

![kthtree2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85506948-78ee-4329-92e9-99ac212afe33)

- Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
- Output: 3

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 10<sup>4</sup>
- 0 <= Node.val <= 10<sup>4</sup>

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
