Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Example 1:

![tree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7716410-f698-405a-9c91-a0bce50044d0)

Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Example 2:
- Input: inorder = [-1], postorder = [-1]
- Output: [-1]

Constraints:
- 1 <= inorder.length <= 3000
- postorder.length == inorder.length
- -3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000
- inorder and postorder consist of unique values.
- Each value of postorder also appears in inorder.
- inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.
- postorder is guaranteed to be the postorder traversal of the tree.
