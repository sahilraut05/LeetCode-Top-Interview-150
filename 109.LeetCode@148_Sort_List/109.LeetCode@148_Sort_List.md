Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in ascending order.

Example 1:

![sort_list_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f791a80c-982f-4e15-b38f-e25877c9dc41)

- Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
- Output: [1,2,3,4]

Example 2:

![sort_list_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41cb5573-b087-4080-9f7c-19a866f961f3)

- Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
- Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]

Example 3:
- Input: head = []
- Output: []

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105
