Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Example 1:

![symtree1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66f5b90f-fd7e-4c67-80e5-1af713f79b3f)

- Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
- Output: true

Example 2:

![symtree2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ffa16c5e-f6ab-4d40-8bc9-5e66ccb53d27)

- Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
- Output: false

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
